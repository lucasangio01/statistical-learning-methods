This project aims to show the application of unsupervised and supervised learning methods on two different datasets: one regarding *basketball data* (unsupervised learning) and one regarding *alcohol consumption among students* (supervised learning).

The following algorithms have been used:
- `Unsupervised Learning`:
  - Principal component analysis;
  - K-means clustering;
  - Hierarchical clustering;
  - T-sne;
  - DBSCAN clustering.

- `Supervised Learning`:
  - Linear regression;
  - Random forest regression;
  - XGboost and K-folds cross validation;
  - Various classification methods;
  - Decision trees.

The code is entirely written in **R** and the project is presented in the PDF file.
